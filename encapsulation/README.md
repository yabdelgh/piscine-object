# Encapsulation
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It refers to the idea of bundling the data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It also restricts access to some of the object's components, which is often done by making some of the object's properties or methods private and only exposing them through public methods (called getters and setters).

The main benefits of encapsulation are:

Data Hiding: It helps protect the internal state of an object from unintended interference and misuse by other parts of the program. Only specific methods are allowed to modify or access the data.

Control Over Data: You can add logic in the getter or setter methods to control how the data is accessed or modified. For example, you might want to check that a value is valid before setting it.

Code Maintenance and Flexibility: Since the internal workings of the object are hidden, you can modify the implementation of the class without affecting other parts of the program that use the class.
